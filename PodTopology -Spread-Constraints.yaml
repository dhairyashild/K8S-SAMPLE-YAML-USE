Pod Topology Spread Constraints
              control how Pods are distributed across different failure domains (e.g., regions, zones, nodes) to enhance availability and resource utilization.

Key Components:
maxSkew: Defines the maximum allowed unevenness in Pod distribution. Must be greater than zero.
topologyKey: Specifies the topology domain (like zone or node) for spreading Pods.topology.   (   kubernetes.io/region   , topology.kubernetes.io/zone)
whenUnsatisfiable: Determines the action when constraints cannot be met (e.g., DoNotSchedule keeps the Pod pending).
labelSelector: Filters which Pods the constraints apply to based on labels.

Benefits:
Improves fault tolerance by preventing a single point of failure.
Optimizes resource utilization by distributing workloads evenly.

kind: Pod

  name: mypod

    foo: bar
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: zone
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        foo: bar

Limitations:
Constraints may not remain satisfied if Pods are removed (e.g., during scaling down).
